# Contributing to Leikr

Leikr is not only intended to be a welcome platform for those creating games, it's a welcome platform for those willing to improve Leikr as a game creation tool.

Leikr is written in Java and uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to build.

## Building Leikr

## Contributing Code

1. Fork the Leikr repository using the Fork button on the main repository.

1. Clone your forked repository to your local machine. Create a new branch (do not use `master`) for your intended changes. Please try to be descriptive as to the branch contents, and try to limit the scope of a single branch.
