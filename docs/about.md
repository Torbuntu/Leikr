# About Leikr


## Origin

The word Leikr is Old Norse for [Game](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/leikr). It is a play on the name Lego, from the Danish ["Leg Godt"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego), meaning "Play Well". 


## Goals

Leikr aims to be a platform for unleashing creativity in an easy to use format. with a simple project structure and easy to learn robust [API](https://github.com/torbuntu/leikr/wiki/api) in the [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) programming language.
Wether you are just starting out in programming, or are a professional, Leikr is a great system for easily prototyping and building out games and programs. Since under the hood Leikr is built in Java, it can run on the top major Operating Systems, but also designed to run on the Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+ and 3A+. 

The primary objectives of the Leikr system
1. Help teach Groovy, Java and the JVM.
2. Provide a platform for making Games and Programs with similar look and feel to Gameboy Advance era games.

## Tools

Most Fantasy Console systems typically come with all or some of the tools needed for making games baked in, ready to go out of the box. Since the goals of Leikr do not include teaching how to use new tools, they are not in the initial scope of the platform. 

Instead, Leikr aims to promote the use of whatever tools someone is most comfortable with. For example, I personally use the following:

| Type | Tool | Note |
|----|----|-----|
| Art, Sprites | [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) / [LibreSprite](https://github.com/LibreSprite/LibreSprite), [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) | for sprites Leikr needs a file called Sprites.png, but in the art directory any png file will work |
| Music | [LMMS](https://lmms.io/), [FL Studio](https://image-line.com) | Leikr uses .WAV files for Music |
| Sfx | [SFXR](https://lmms.io/wiki/index.php?title=SFXR), [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) | Leikr uses .WAV files for SFX |
| Code | [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/), [Gedit](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit), [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) | Any Text editor with support for Groovy highlighting will be plenty sufficient |

Using simple to make assets allows for users to use any tools they wish for developing for Leikr.
